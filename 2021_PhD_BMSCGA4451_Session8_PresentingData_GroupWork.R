# Data Visualization for Presentation Group Work

#1. Try making a chart with both points and a line for center time vs center distance.


#2. Make a histogram of center distance travelled, experiment with updating the binwidth. Make a boxplot of body weight by attack combined.


#3. Make a bar chart comparing the mean brainweight of attacking mice with error bars. 


#4. Explore the color brewer scales. Try using "display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = T)" to see the color blind friendly palettes. Add a color blind friendly palette to a chart of activity time vs. center distance, coloring by if they attacked or not (attack_combine)


#5. Make a chart of activity time vs. center distance and adjust the x access to have labeled breaks in increments of 2500 and the Y access in increments of 2000. 


#6. Copy your last chart and try out some of the themes available in Ggplot to update the background. What contexts would you want a lighter vs a darker background?
