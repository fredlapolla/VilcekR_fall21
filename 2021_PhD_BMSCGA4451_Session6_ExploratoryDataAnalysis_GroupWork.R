# Exploratory Data Visualization Group Work

#1. Try to make a histogram of center time and a histogram of task time on day 1. Are these normally distributed? Are they skewed, and if so, which way?

#2. Make a box plot of body weight by sex, for these mice. Are they likely the same for both groups?

#3. Make a qq plot of task time on day one. Also make one for body weight. Would you expect either of these to be normal or skewed? How can you tell?

#4. If we wanted to make a scatter plot of errors on day 1 vs activity, how would we do it? Based on what you now know about assessing skew, what test might we run for this?
