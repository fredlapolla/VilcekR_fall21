# R Session 4 Functions Group Work

## 1. Group Work Functions

#Write a function to calculate the Z score of bodyweight (bw). A Z score is a standardized number letting us know essentially how "far" a given value is from the average value of a column, when accounting for how much variation there is in that column. It is a useful tool for knowing if a given value is close to the average, given how much difference there is in the group, or if it is a value far from average. Z Scores are used in many statistical tests you will learn about in the second half of the course. The formula is:
  
 # Z = (x-mu)/sd
  
  #Where X is a given value, mu is the mean value of x, and sd is the standard deviation of x. 

## 2. Apply Breakoutwork

#Use apply to find the Z scores of the center_dist, center_time, periphery_dist and periphery_time columns of crusio1:
  

# Group Work 3
#Breakout work

#Try using ifelse and quantile to make a dichotomous variable separating the top fifth of center times (so 80% and up as a quantile), from other values


## Group Work 4

#Try filtering to only have mice who attacked on either day (attack_combine).
